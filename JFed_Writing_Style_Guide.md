## Voice Characteristics

### Three Voice Pillars

**1. Honest and Relatable**
- Share real struggles, not just wins
- Admit when you're still figuring it out
- Use phrases like "I'm learning," "still working on," "got me thinking"
- Don't project false confidence or hide the mess

**2. Curious and Growth-Minded**
- Frame failures as learning opportunities
- Ask questions rather than claiming to have all answers
- Use language of exploration: "diving into," "figuring out," "challenged me"
- Avoid claiming expertise you haven't earned yet

**3. Faith-Integrated, Not Preachy**
- Weave Scripture and God's work naturally into the narrative
- Don't force spiritual language where it doesn't fit
- Reference faith as part of the journey, not the sales pitch
- Use phrases like "where God takes me," "honor God with," "surrender in some areas"

---

## Writing Patterns & Syntax

### Sentence Structure
- **Mix short and medium sentences** - Jason doesn't write long, complex sentences often
- **Lead with action or feeling** - "I walked into this week skeptical" not "This week, I was skeptical when I walked in"
- **Use fragments occasionally for emphasis** - "It was uncomfortable. But that's where I learn best."
- **Active voice over passive** - "Dan Rice nailed it" not "It was well-presented by Dan Rice"

### Paragraph Style
- **Keep paragraphs short** - 2-4 sentences is the sweet spot
- **One idea per paragraph** - Don't pack multiple thoughts together
- **Use white space** - Makes content more readable and conversational

### Opening Lines
Jason's natural openers:
- "What's up, I'm Jason Feddersen..."
- "I walked into [situation] skeptical..."
- "Here's what I learned about..."
- "[Topic] hit different this week..."
- "I'm still figuring out..."

### Transitions
Natural connectors Jason uses:
- "That landed hard..."
- "It got me thinking about..."
- "The question I'm sitting with now is..."
- "Thankfully..."
- "I know I..."
- "That's where..."

---

## Word Choice & Vocabulary

### Words/Phrases Jason Uses Naturally
- "What's up" (casual greeting)
- "hit different" (something impacted deeply)
- "nailed it" (did something well)
- "figuring it out"
- "diving into" / "diving deep"
- "roller coaster"
- "willing to fail forward"
- "let's be honest"
- "I know I..." (self-awareness)
- "still have a long way to go"
- "Thankfully..."

### Hedging Words (Use Sparingly)
Jason naturally uses these but should reduce them for stronger writing:
- "I think" 
- "maybe"
- "possibly" 
- "probably"
- "I suppose"
- "kind of" / "sort of"

**When to use them:** Only when genuinely expressing uncertainty or exploring an idea. Cut them when they weaken a clear statement.

### Words/Phrases to AVOID
- **Em dashes (—)** - Jason doesn't like them; use commas, periods, or semicolons instead
- **Overly formal language** - "utilize" → "use," "facilitate" → "help," "endeavor" → "try"
- **Corporate buzzwords** - "synergy," "leverage," "circle back," "touch base"
- **Churchy clichés without context** - "bless your heart," "hedge of protection," "love on people"
- **Academic throat-clearing** - "It is important to note that," "One might consider," "In conclusion"
- **Fake polish** - Don't make Jason sound like a motivational poster

---

## Faith Integration Guidelines

### How Jason Talks About Faith

**Natural Integration:**
- Weave in as part of the narrative, not as the point
- Reference specific Scripture with context (not just verse dumping)
- Connect faith to real struggles: "I need to learn that God has a blank canvas for me"
- Show growth and doubt alongside faith: "Sometimes I feel like a hypocrite"

**Examples from Jason's Writing:**
✅ "I'm excited to see where God takes me next"
✅ "Trying to honor God with that"
✅ "I know I could easily make it about the money too"
✅ "Thankfully, God's masterpiece is a blank canvas for our lives"
✅ "I need to look at how I live my life in public and private"

**Avoid:**
❌ Forced spiritual language: "God just laid it on my heart to share..."
❌ Prosperity gospel vibes: "God wants you to be blessed and successful"
❌ Preachy tone: "You need to surrender your life to Christ today"
❌ Verse stacking without explanation: Just quoting 5 verses in a row

### Scripture Usage
- **Reference specific passages with context** - Not just verse numbers
- **Explain what it means** - Don't assume everyone knows
- **Connect to personal experience** - "Paul talks about this struggle in Romans 7:14-20. We don't do what we want to do, but we end up doing the thing we hate"

---

## Technical/Professional Writing

### When Writing About Video/Photo Work
- **Be specific:** "shooting in natural light" not "using lighting techniques"
- **Share process:** What you tried, what failed, what worked
- **Growth-focused:** What you learned, not just what you did
- **Example:** "I definitely was challenged having to edit on different software, storyboard an idea with someone, and work on grabbing clips to help the idea come to life."
